Pitch Counter is a helpful Android Application for baseball coaches. Pitch Counter keeps track of the number of pitches per pitcher for a coachâ€™s baseball team (middle school, league, and high school baseball have a cap for the maximum number of pitches a pitcher can pitch). The coach can add or remove a pitcher, view all the games and the number of pitches per game that the player pitched, and in each game, the number of strikes and balls that they pitched. The coach, of course, can edit the number of strikes/balls for any game at any time, delete games, and add past games. Pitch Counter also allows the coach to view different amounts of information for each pitcher: their average ratio (number of strikes/total number of pitches), ratio per game, and graphs of when they played, how much they pitched, and how many strikes/balls they pitched. Additionally, the coach can sort the list of players based upon the pitcher who pitched last, has either the least or most number of pitches, or either the highest or lowest average ratio.
